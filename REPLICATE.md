# Inline edit formatting

The user wanted inline edits to preserve paragraph and homogeneous direct text styles while retaining intentional whole-paragraph Markdown formatting.

- Added failing exact-request tests before implementation, then passed paragraph/run context from the CLI to the replacement planner; partial list and heading markers now remain literal prose.
- Restored differing direct style fields only over the inserted span, using field-mask resets for absent overrides; covered paragraph starts, UTF-16 ranges, table cells, tabs, conflict warnings, and mixed inline/block matches with `--all`.
- All 1,578 unit tests and the no-stubs gate pass. Full Ruff remains blocked by 196 pre-existing violations, confirmed against the unchanged baseline; this change adds none.
- On one throwaway document, two synthetic edits preserved alignment, link, highlight, list state, and all raw style overrides. Literal JSON equality failed because Google split one run into two with identical styles; coalescing only that split confirmed the two text replacements were the only content changes. The document was trashed.
- Kept mixed-style length-changing edits outside the supported guarantees and left pushing and pull-request creation to the next agent.
